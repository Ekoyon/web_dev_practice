<h1>Git basics</h1>
<p>Git is a free and open-source version control system, originally created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. Unlike older
    centralized version control systems such as SVN and CVS, Git is distributed: every developer has the full history of
    their code repository locally. This makes the initial clone of the repository slower, but subsequent operations such
    as <b>commit, blame, diff, merge, and log</b> dramatically faster.</p>

<h2>How Git works</h2>
<p>Here is a basic overview of how Git works:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Create a "repository" (project) with a git hosting tool (like Bitbucket)</li>
    <li>Copy (or clone) the repository to your local machine</li>
    <li>Add a file to your local repo and "commit" (save) the changes</li>
    <li>"Push" your changes to your main branch</li>
    <li>Make a change to your file with a git hosting tool and commit</li>
    <li>"Pull" the changes to your local machine</li>
    <li>Create a "branch" (version), make a change, commit the change</li>
    <li>Open a "pull request" (propose changes to the main branch)</li>
    <li>"Merge" your branch to the main branch</li>
</ol>
